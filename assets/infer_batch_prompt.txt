An obese middle-aged male security guard, walking and looking around
The boy clutched the flowers tightly with both hands, hiding them behind his back, his body taut and eyes fixed ahead. As the girl approached, his face instantly lit up with a smile, and he quickly strode forward, swiftly extending his right hand to offer the flowers.
The man stood in the downpour. Upon seeing the woman, his head jerked to the left with a pained look of avoidance, and his body leaned back slightly.
The woman approached the man. Her right hand trembled as she raised it, intending to touch his face.
The reserved man and the shy woman sat side by side on the edge of the bed. After a furtive glance at the woman, the man coughed lightly, his body gradually edging closer. His hands rubbed on his knees, his movements somewhat awkward.
The woman's hands were intertwined, nervously twisting the corner of her clothing, her gaze cast downward.
In the cluttered kitchen, the slightly plump man frantically flipped the pan with his right hand while his left hand scrambled to grab the seasonings. After knocking over the salt shaker, oil splattered in the pan. His eyes widened, his mouth gaped open, and he jumped on the spot with both feet. The spatula flew out of his hand, and he stumbled, looking utterly disheveled.
The boss was speaking in a measured and serious manner, with his left hand behind his back and his right hand occasionally gesturing. Suddenly, upon hearing a sound of flatulence, his expression changed abruptly, and his right hand froze in mid-air.

The woman gazed out at the vast ocean, her body swaying as she slowly and heavily made her way towards the precipice.
A strong man in deep sorrow rushed to the scene, running while reaching out and shouting with a voice filled with despair, his steps faltering.
The emaciated woman sat on the floor, her hands wrapped around her knees as she trembled, her head buried in her arms, sobbing, her body curled up.
The woman ran in small quick steps, gradually slowing down, standing on her tiptoes to wave, gazing into the distance with tearful eyes.
The tall and capable woman adjusted her collar in front of the mirror, took a deep breath, straightened her posture, and smiled confidently. With her right hand holding a bag and her left hand opening the door, she walked out with a light step, her posture upright.
The athletes warmed up, their feet alternating in quick jumps, their hands clenched into fists swinging back and forth. After the whistle blew, they shot off like arrows, their feet rapidly alternating, their arms swinging with power, sprinting towards the finish line with all their might.
The tall detective held a flashlight, moving slowly with a slight lean forward, turning his head to observe his surroundings. Upon spotting blood, he quickly crouched down, his left hand supporting his knee, and with his right hand, he directed the flashlight's beam, his gaze focused and thoughtful.
The robust expedition leader held a map in his hand, occasionally looking up to observe the surrounding environment, moving slowly and cautiously. His left hand slightly raised to signal the team to halt, his right index finger pressed to his lips in a gesture for silence. His body was taut, and he strained to listen to any movements around them.
